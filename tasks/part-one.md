# Imagine these hypothetical scenarios and write down answers to these questions:

## Support writes in your teamâ€™s chat about a big bug in production - what do you do?
I'd jump on the call with the support rep, to get more info about and in order to get clear details on how to reproduce the defect. I'd report it and ping the decision-maker(s), for instance my team lead or project manager, so the bug can be assigned to the developer and prioritized so the development team can start working on it as soon as possible. Once the bug is fixed in prod, I'd push for a detailed root cause analysis so we can pin-point why it happened in order to prevent it, and similar issues in the future. I'd also use this as an opportunity to identify potential areas of improvement - to make our process more effective in future similar scenarios, if our testing missed this bug try to figure out why, without passing any blame and pointing fingers.

## In the daily standup, you hear that we need to deliver very fast and cannot implement unit tests - how would you react to that?
I understand that sometimes in the real world we are forced to make unpleasant decisions, but, I'd try to advise against it, if it's at all possible, if not I'd look for a compromise solution and try to make sure that this is just a temporary thing and that these unit tests will be added retroactively. As a big believer in the importance of unit testing (it helps a lot to prevent the most embarrassing kinds of bugs) I'd raise this issue on the retrospective and fight to make sure that skipping unit testing is only temporary.


## Team you recently joined is confused about the role of the QA. How would you explain it to them in a few sentences?
I had this situation while working with a team of developers who practiced TDD. On the first glance their skepticism seemed logical - they do the unit and integration testing and the BA does the acceptance testing, where would a QA fit in there? I see the role of a QA in the terms of Modern Testing Principles, as more of a quality advocate, rather than the only person responsible for testing. Speaking from experience, best software is made if we have a whole-team approach to quality, as each role can add unique value to our testing efforts - this means that the responsibility for the quality of the product is shared and only organization who are mature enough, and willing to invest a lot of effort can pull this off. A good QA can act like a coach for the team and help them improve the overall testing.
